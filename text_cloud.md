## Question

I want to transfer a piece of small text (no more than 25 bytes) between to PCs.

I don't want to transfer the data via local area network or flash drives, rather I want to put the piece of text on the web somewhere on some free "paste text" service with a nice short URL form which I could copy the data in the other computer.

No registration needed, just pasting from one computer and gathering from another computer.

Recommended any such tool.
